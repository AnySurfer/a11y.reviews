description: Community reviews on the accessibility of tools and services.
---

A community-driven resource to both find and share information on the accessibility of tools, services, platforms, and so on.

If you have experience with a resource and how accessible it may or may not be, please contribute. Ideally, if you follow the existing format this will be much easier for others to use as well as for us to maintain.

The document is managed on GitHub and uses Markdown for contributions. If you do not use GitHub and/or Markdown, you can still submit via email (email address needed). At launch, this has been seeded with one review to demonstrate the format.

## Online Surveys

Tools used for polls, surveys, or questionnaires.

### Typeform

Typeform generally does not work with screen readers across platforms. Field labels are not exposed correctly, question navigation is problematic, and answers are not consistently exposed. Color contrast is below WCAG minimums.

There is no public bug tracker to follow issues.
